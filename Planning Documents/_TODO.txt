++TODO++

- Black Hole improvements
	- OnCollection, make black hole react (twitch, aka, slightly enlarge, 
	then go back to small, or even a black pulsing aura via light 
	or particle system)
	- Show suction via particle system
	- Make BlackHole event time-based
		-Rather than spawning new target as soon as all currency 
			is collected, add a second delay and animation of blackhole
			calapsing on self
- Have 2 collectors
	- make sure collectors do not move towards same currency
- Create shop option to purchase more Collectors
- Create Resting Heart Rate influencer
- Create background 'dust' from particle system
- Add effect when target is damaged
- Add effect when target takes NO damage (calculated dmg radius is 0)
	- TODO in ProjectileController, but move to separate script
- Move Projectiles to "pooling system" rather than Instantiate+Destroy

++ Is there any way to involve choice???
	- can pertain to the fact that not all resources can be gathered...
