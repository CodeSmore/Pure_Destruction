- Black Hole improvements
	- Show suction via particle system
		+ play particle system on awake
		+ Once 'BlackHole' appears, restart particle effect, then enable 
			velocity over lifetime (necessary to reset timer)
		+ On new stage, disable velocity over lifetime and restart effect
		- Reseed the particle random seed
		- When 'BlackHole' begins to contract, increase speed of particle inward movement
- Have 2 collectors
	- make sure collectors do not move towards same currency
- Create shop option to purchase more Collectors
- Create Resting Heart Rate influencer
- Create background 'dust' from particle system
- Add effect when target is damaged
- Add effect when target takes NO damage (calculated dmg radius is 0)
	- TODO in ProjectileController, but move to separate script
- Move Projectiles to "pooling system" rather than Instantiate+Destroy

++ Is there any way to involve choice???
	- can pertain to the fact that not all resources can be gathered...
