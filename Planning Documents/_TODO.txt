++TODO++

NOTE: Refactoring is needed
++ Focus on decoupling, making static variables when possible, ease to 
knowing where and how to make changes, and ease of reading/understanding

- Black Hole improvements
	- OnCollection, make black hole react (twitch, aka, slightly enlarge, then go back to 
	small, or even a black pulsing aura via light or particle system)
	- Show suction via particle system
- Have 2 collectors
	- make sure collectors do not move towards same currency
- Create shop option to purchase more Collectors
- Create Resting Heart Rate influencer
- Create background 'dust' from particle system
- Add effect when target is damaged
- Add effect when target takes NO damage (calculated dmg radius is 0)
	- TODO in ProjectileController
- Move Projectiles to "pooling system" rather than Instantiate+Destroy

++ Is there any way to involve choice???
	- can pertain to the fact that not all resources can be gathered...
	
	
side note: 
- 'Ctrl + .' refactors highlighted code to new method
- It may be smart to put all input related actions in a single class, then call methods
