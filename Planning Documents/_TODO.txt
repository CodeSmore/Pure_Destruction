++TODO++

- Have 2 collectors
	- make sure collectors do not move towards same currency
- Create shop option to purchase more Collectors
- Create Resting Heart Rate influencer
- Add effect when target is damaged
- Add effect when target takes NO damage (calculated dmg radius is 0)
	- TODO in ProjectileController, but move to separate script
- Move Projectiles to "pooling system" rather than Instantiate+Destroy

++ Is there any way to involve choice???
	- can pertain to the fact that not all resources can be gathered...
