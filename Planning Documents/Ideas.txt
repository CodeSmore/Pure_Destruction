** Something to destroy collectors **

Pros: 
- new dimension to gameplay

Cons:
- player frustration over losing resource
- waiting times / cost inefficiency to get them back

** Currencies explode out from target, then stop, rather than constantly moving

Pros:
- easier to collect non-moving targets 
	- less "lost" currency 
- player feels less waste

Cons:
- less impact of the collectors as a mechanic
( they're no longer doing something to counter the difficulty of the player)

Thinking point: 
- is "loss" a good thing in a game?
	- loss = being unable to collect everything on screen and having to make choices
	- Perhaps, loss is ok, so long as choice is involved
	
** Collectors can have mini-collectors that bring currency to them **

Pros:
- complexity (gameplay)
- fun to see all the minis running around collecting for the biggie
- makes capacity of collector more relevant (new way to upgrade)

Cons:
- large collectors become less important (quantity)
- complexity (building + maintaining)
