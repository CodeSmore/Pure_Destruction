++ Project Overview ++

Summary: 

The goal is to create an idle/incremental game that is engaging, yet
calming and aesthetically satisfying.

Influencers:

Bomber - Idle game that shows a planet being bombarded by explosives.
	Each impact shows chunks of the planet being destroyed, eventually
	exposing the weak center. When the center is hit, the level ends,
	and a new one begins, with a planet of increased resistance and 
	occasionally a gimmik (such as a orbiting obstacles). A big reason
	for me liking this game is the pleasing nature of the visual
	representation of progress and the calming vibration of the phone
	w/ each impact.
	
Core Ideals:

- Satisfying feedback from the game
- Compelling progression
- Calming/soothing
